Non-Local Means is a powerful algorithm for image denoising, yet its high computational complexity limits real-time application. This paper replicates the Monte Carlo Non-Local Means Optimization, which utilizes random sampling to accelerate weight calculations without significantly degrading peak signal-to-noise ratio.
